# Vector-Space-Model

Assignment Objective 

This assignment focuses on Vector Space Model(VSM) for information retrieval. You will be 
implementing and testing a set of queries using VSM for information retrieval. You need to build 
a vector space of features using some specified feature selection techniques. The dimension of the 
space will be Rn
, the query is also represented in the same feature space. Cosine similarity is used 
to compute the similarity between documents and queries. 

Datasets 
You are given a collection of Trump Speeches (File name: Trump Speeches 56 files) for 
implementing inverted index and positional index. A single file contains a single speech from All 
of Trump's Speeches from June 2015 to November 9, 2016. You also need to implement a preprocessing pipeline. It is recommended to first review the given text file for indexing. You need 
to treat each document as a unique document. This observation offers you many clues for your 
pipeline implementation and feature extraction. You will be implementing term feature selection 
based on Term Frequency (tf) and Document Frequency (df) scoring. The parameters of tf and df 
can be set while creating a specific space of representation. The set of queries are also provided 
for this assignment. You need to place the queries on the same space and compute the score based 
on cosine similarity. The weighting scheme used for VSM will be tf*idf, which is a combination 
of both tf (term frequency of term t in a document) and idf (inverse document frequency computing 
as (log(df)/ N). 

Query Processing 
The query processing of VSM is quite tricky, you need of optimize every aspect of computation. 
The high-dimensional vector product and similarity values of query (q) and documents (d) need to 
optimized. 
Basic Assumption for Vector Space Model (VSM) Retrieval Model 
1.Simple model based on linear algebra. Terms are considered as features using a weighting 
scheme. 
2.Allows partial matching of documents with the queries. Hence, able to produce good institutive 
scoring. Continuous scoring between queries and documents. 
3.Ranking of documents are possible using relevance score between document and query. 
As we discussed during the lectures, we will implement a VSM Model by selecting features from 
the document by specifying tf and df values. You are free to implement a posting list with your 
choice of data structures; you are only allowed to preprocess the text from the documents in term 
of tokenization in which you can do case folding, stop-words removal and lemmatization. The stop 
word list is also provided to you with assignments files. Your query processing routine must 
address a query parsing, evaluation of the cost, and through executing it to fetch the required list of documents. The list of documents should be filtered with an alpha value say (ÔÅ°= 0.0005), A 
command line interface is simply required to demonstrate the working model. You are also 
provided by a set of 10 queries, for evaluating your implementation. 
 
Coding can be done in either Java, C/C++, Python, or C# programming language. There are 
additional marks for intuitive GUI for demonstrating the working VSM along with free text query 
search. Coding can be done in either Java, Python, C/C++ or C# programming language. There 
are additional marks for intuitive GUI for demonstrating the working Boolean Model along with 
phrase query search. 

Files Provided with this Assignment:
